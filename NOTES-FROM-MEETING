global_definitions.asm 
    can remove GUI
my_isr.asm
    could rewrite
    replace with current ISR, adjust counter
pitch_data.asm 
    actually tracker will no longer need this once it's just sending
    notes to the synth engine
synth_engine.asm 
timbres.asm
    AKA instruments
voice.asm
zeropage.asm
    (ISR, remove player, plugin mine)
    also note the use of dynamic assingment here, nifty!
utility_macros.asm

Other notes:
Some effects (vibrato, volume slide) could be done via the tracker.
Vibrato can adjust the pitch param in timbers. Right now it's corase
but Carl may add fine (or perhaps I can look)
Argp: Use pitch
Vol Slide/Tremolo: adjust volume param directly

loading concentro GUI code into hi RAM?
    could be a nice way to have an instrument UI before there's a 
    native one (or concerto might be good enough)
    Also if ROM area has some RAM-banks as Kevin hinted at, could work
    there too.
